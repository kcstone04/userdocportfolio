      <h1 class="w3-text-pink">Print User Guide</h1>
      <p>This assignment was for me write a step-by-step guide to a simple task in my chosen software. The software I chose was Steam, the videogame marketplace and library application. This choice will extend into most of the other assignments. The task I chose was to simply find, purchase, and download a game – the basic task that most people use Steam for. The guide had to be well-written for people who have no idea how to use Steam, and it had to include images as visual aids. </p>

      <h1 class="w3-text-pink">Video User Guide</h1>
      <p>This assignment was for me to make a video guide walking users through a simple task in my software of choice, Steam. I decided to essentially make an adaptation of my print guide, walking users through the same task in a different guide format. This video required me to record a video of my screen and microphone, and ensure the guide was the proper length, and paced well to make it easy to follow. </p>

      <h1 class="w3-text-pink">Usability Test Documents</h1>
      <p>This assignment was for me to conduct usability tests of my two user guides, the print user guide and the video user guide. I had two of my friends follow the guides to the best of their ability, and I observed how well it went. They gave me feedback at the end, which I noted down. The deliverables for this assignment were to make a script for each test, each with a selection of questions meant to guide the tests, and a consent form for each of my test users to sign.  </p>

      <p>This assignment was for me to write up a report on the usability tests I previously conducted. The report included the summary, methodology, goals, key findings, and results of the test. I also included info about the participants, and the feedback I received from them.  </p>

      <h1 class="w3-text-pink">User Profiles</h1>
      <p>This assignment was to lay out some basic, important information about my test participants. The profiles were anonymous, completely leaving out their names and other easily identifiable information. Profiles like this are useful to get an idea of the type of people you are writing your documentation for. </p>

      <p>This assignment was to use pieces of info about my test participants, much of which was included in the user profiles, to create a detailed profile for an imaginary person. Personas like this can be practically useful as a way of combining information drawn from many, many individual profiles. For this assignment, it was just a combination of two people, so it wasn’t particularly representative of anything. </p>
